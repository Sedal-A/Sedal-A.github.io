        <ul> 
          <li><strong>Listen, Learn and Teach</strong> people from all walks of life - my favourite saying is <strong>"The Whole is Greater than the Sum of its Parts"</strong>. Being able to listen to other people's opinions and implementing their ideas could lead to a better end product, worst case it could allow us to <strong>approach a problem in a new way</strong> and hopefully give us a new sense of awareness for potential issues in the future.</li><br>
          <li><strong>I love to get stuck in</strong> - be it with group projects or individual tasks. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty or own up to any mistakes. <strong>I believe to Learn and Grow, you first need to be honest with yourself and others.</strong></li><br>
          <li><strong>I love to try new things</strong> - it could be something as simple as trying new recipes and activities or going out of my comfort zone. <strong>These activities have allowed me to learn more about myself and my friends.</strong> </li><br>
          <li><strong>I love friendly competition and a challenge</strong> regardless of how small it may seem, be it a game of Football or which team could finish a project to a higher standard. <strong>As long as it's kept within a friendly/healthy environment.</strong> </li><br>
          <li>I'm <strong>creative in my approach to Problems-solving,</strong> but I'll touch up on this in the <strong>project section.</strong></li><br>

        <ul>      
          <li>It's an <strong>interesting fast-paced environment</strong> where you will <strong>always have the opportunity to learn.</strong></li><br>
          <li>I want to <strong>learn how websites work</strong> and what's needed to keep them <strong>running and engaging.</strong></li><br>

          <li>It's a <strong>great outlet for Creativity.</strong> For example, websites like Nike allow you to customise a pair of shoes and <strong>see how they look in real-time.</strong> 
            I want to learn and make websites that will have a <strong>positive impact on people.</strong></li><br>

      <h3>Why Founders and Coders</h3><br>
        <p> 
          Honestly just speaking with Dan, Sarah, Petra and everyone else at the meetups showed me that Founder and Coders <strong>genuinely care about the students and their learning.</strong><br><br>
        <strong>That's the most important thing when looking for an environment to learn</strong>, I don't mind if there isn't an apprenticeship at the end of the course, since I believe it will still be the right step I need to start my career.

          <p>as promised here is an example of my 
          <br>
            Creativity and Problem-Solving.  
          <br>
          <br>
          I needed a new desk and after looking 
          <br>
          online I thought to myself why don't 
          <br>
          I just make one myself? 
          <br>
          So I started to search online looking 
          <br>
          for ideas and materials. 
          <br><br>
          Once I felt I had a semi-solid idea
          <br>
          I asked my friend who works in 
          <br>
          construction. 
          <br>
          I then looked for the best deals and 
          <br>
          ordered the material.
          <br>
          While I was making the desk a came across a 
          <br>
          problem, I stopped and asked my friend why 
          <br>
          I was facing this problem and what 
          <br>
          I could do to solve it
